# Badly Designed Systems 

### Why? 

Systems design follows a very predictable pattern with essentially the same questions: How do we improve reliability, scalability, user experience, etc.

But we don’t often stop and shine a light on the other side of systems design; Why certain design choices aren't the best, and how quickly they collapse under load. That’s what this repo is about: a collection of deliberately fragile systems.

Run these little POCs, observe where they break, and talk about what real systems do differently.
